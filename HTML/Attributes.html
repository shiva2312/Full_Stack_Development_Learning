        In this we will understand about the HTML attributes
    </h1>

    <ul>
        <li>
            All HTML elements can have attributes
        </li>
        <li>
            Attributes provide additional information about elements
        </li>
        <li>
            Attributes are always specified in the start tag
        </li>
        <li>
            Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"
        </li>
        <li>
            Now let see the example of attributes:-
            <ol>
                <li>
                    img tag may have <b>href="Source of file"</b> where <b>href</b> can be considered as attributed
                </li>
                <li>
                    suppose if we want to define the width and height of the image in the img tag then we can use
                    <b>width</b> and <b>Height</b> attributes.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>With this we have understood the Attributes functionality in HTML. Now we will see how we did the points in
        bullets points and number list:- </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            To maintain a numbered format for the points, it is necessary to utilize the <b>ol</b> tag, which stands for
            "ordered list," and nest the individual list items within <b>li</b> tags.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <ul>
        <li>
            To maintain a bullet point format for the items, the <b>ul</b> tag, which represents an "unordered list,"
            should
            be used. Each individual list item should be enclosed within <b>li</b> tags to create the desired bullet
            list
            structure.
        </li>
    </ul>
