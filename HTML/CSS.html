            In this we will learn about inclusion of CSS in HTML structure.
        </h1>
        <p>
            Basically there are three method by which we can include css in our structure:-
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Internal CSS:-
                    <p>
                        Here basically we include css property and value in header section of html.
                        For example:- &lt;style&gt; body {background : green} &lt;style&gt;
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    External CSS
                </li>
                <p>
                    This means that we have defined the css property in some other file and from there we render that file in the index page or the page where we want to use that file.
                    For example :- &lt;link rel = stylesheet; href = styles.css&gt;
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note:- This need to be included in header section of the file.
                </p>
                <li>
                    Inline CSS
                </li>
                <p>
                    Inline CSS is basically the type where we include the the property and the value in the tag itself.
                    For example :- &lt;p style = "color : green"; &gt; How &lt;p&gt; 
                </p>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </body>
