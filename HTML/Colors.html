    Here will Learn about the HTML colors.
</body>
<p>
    HTML color is basically defined by rgb,hex, hsl and rgba.
</p>
<p>
    We already know how to use color property and the value using Inline css. We have learn this in style lesson.
</p>
<p>
    Now we'll learn about the HTML color values which we pass in rgba,regb,hsl and hex.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        RGB :-
        <p style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">As the name suggest RED GREEN & BLUE. SO using this three color we will design
            our color code.
            <br>
            So we need three integer value to be passsed in RGB and value will be ranging from 0 - 255.
            where 255 denote the pure read.
            <br>
            Let me show you what acutally I have done here. I have used style attribute with this property and value
            style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"
        </p>

    <li>
        RGBA :-
        <p style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0, 0.5);">As the name suggest RED GREEN BLUE and A stands for Alpha. SO using this
            three color and opacity we will design our color code.
            <br>
            Alpha decide the opacity of the colur
            <br>
            Let me show you what acutally I have done here. I have used style attribute with this property and value
            style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0,0.5);"
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        HEX :-
        <p style="color: #2600ff;">
            HEX is simple color code denotation which is represented by HEXADECIMAL number (0-9 and A-F) with # at the beginning.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example :-
            Here I have used style="color: #00ffbb;"
        </p>
    </li>
</ol>

    Rest we will learn when we will go deep into CSS.
